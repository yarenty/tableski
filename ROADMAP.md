# tableski roadmap

> Extracted from the kowalski workspace; the build plan lives in this repo's issues (#1–#7).

Crate version **1.5.0**. Workspace: **[`../ROADMAP.md`](../ROADMAP.md)**.

## Near term

- [ ] Optional Parquet/multi-table registration via CLI flags (without breaking single-table smoke tests).
- [ ] Document performance expectations for large files (streaming vs load).

## Medium term

- [ ] Optional Ballista / distributed path (only if it fits the same MCP surface).

## Done (1.1.0)

- [x] Same MCP/DataFusion scope as 1.0.0; crate version aligned with workspace **1.3.0** release line (see root [`CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md)).

## Done (1.0.0 baseline)

- [x] Streamable HTTP MCP, `query_sql` / `get_schema` / `column_statistics`, Docker + smoke test.
